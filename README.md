# GuessTheMovie

# Introduction
  
   This program uses starter code (movies.txt) from the Udacity Java Object-Oriented Programming Course. 
   I added the functionality for the game, which is like hangman for movies. Just run the Main class 
   from a terminal or Java IDE, and the game should begin.
   
# How to Personalize
  
  Feel free to edit movies.txt to include your favorite movies or to switch up the titles for more
  variety.
